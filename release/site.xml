         OCL2AC: OCL2AC is a tool based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and can automatically update model transfomrations to guarantee a set of constraints. It consists of two main components:

(1) OCL2GC: translates OCL constraints to graph constraints.
(2) GC2AC: integrates graph constraints as application conditions for transformation rules.

Each component can be used independently as an Eclipse-based tool.
