         OCL2AC: OCL2AC is a tool based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and consists of two main components:

(1) OCL2NGC: translates OCL constraints into nested graph constraints.
(2) NGC2AC: integrates graph constraints as application conditions
into transformation rules.

Each component can be used independently as an Eclipse-based
tool.
