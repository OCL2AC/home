         OCL2AC: OCL2AC is a tool based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework
(EMF) and consists of two main components:
(1) OCL2NGC: translates OCL constraints into nested graph constraints.
(2) NGC2AC: integrates graph constraints as guaranteeing application conditions
into transformation rules.
(2.1) (new) Optimizer for constructing optimized validity-preserving apllication conditions
Each component can be used independently as an Eclipse-based
tool.
